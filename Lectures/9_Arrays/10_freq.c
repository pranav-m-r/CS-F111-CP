/*
Write a function that takes an int array and returns the element with the highest frequency. 
Assume there is exactly one element with the highest frequency.
*/

Solution 1: 
2 loops:
    Outer loop: traverses through all the elements in the array
    Inner loop: calculates the frequency and compares with the max freq till then.

Solution 2:
Sort the array. Then traverse it to find the max frequency.

Solution 3: 
Using hashmaps. Not in the scope of CP.
