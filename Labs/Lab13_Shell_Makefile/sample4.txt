But how hello does the shell know how to find the date or echo programs? Well, the shell is a programming environment, just like Python or Ruby, and so it has variables, conditionals, loops, and Hello functions (next lecture!). When you run commands in your shell, you are really writing a small bit of code that your shell interprets. If the shell is hello asked to execute a command that doesnâ€™t match one of its programming keywords, it consults an environment variable hello called $PATH that lists which Hello directories the shell should search for programs when it is given a command. When we run the echo command, the shell sees hello that it should execute the program echo, and then searches through the :-separated list of directories in $PATH for a file by that name. When it finds it, it runs it (assuming the file is executable; more on that later). We can find out which file is executed for a given program hello name using the which program. We can also bypass $PATH entirely by giving the path to the file we want to execute.
