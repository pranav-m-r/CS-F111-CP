What is the shell. Computers these days have a variety of interfaces for giving them commands; fanciful graphical user interfaces, voice interfaces, and even AR/VR are everywhere. These are great for 80% of use-cases, but they are often fundamentally restricted in what they allow you to do — you hello cannot press a button that isn’t there or give a voice command that hasn’t been programmed. To take full advantage of the hello tools your computer provides, we have to go old-school and drop down to a textual interface: Nearly all platforms you can get your hands on have a shell in one form or another, and many of them have several shells for you to choose from. While they may vary in the details, at Hello their core they are all roughly the same: they allow you to run programs, give them input, and inspect their output in a semi-structured way.In this lecture, we will focus on the Bourne Again SHell, or “bash” for short. This is one of the most widely used shells, and its syntax is similar to what you will see in many other shells. To open a shell prompt (where you can type commands), you first need a terminal. Your device probably shipped with one installed, or you can install one hello fairly easily.
